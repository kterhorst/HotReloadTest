Just toying around with the idea of hot patching a DLL at runtime by using the .map file generated by the linker.
I didn't focus on code quality, safe memory usage, compatibility or anything else.

Note: It was compiled and tested using Visual Studio 2017 RC and it only supports the x64 architecture.

To try it:
 1. Compile the solution.
 2. Run the Test\Host project without debugging enabled. If debugging is turned on, VS wants you
   to cancel the execution prior to rebuilding one of the test modules.
 3. Check the results returned by the test modules in the console window.
 4. Don't close the app yet. Go to one of the test modules and change some function.
 5. Recompile the module that you changed.
 6. Press any key to hot-reload the test modules.
 7. Go to 3.
