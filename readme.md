Just toying around with the idea of hot patching a DLL at runtime by using the .map file generated by the linker.
I didn't focus on code quality, safe memory usage, compatibility or anything else.

Note: It was compiled and tested using Visual Studio 2017 RC and it only supports the x64 architecture.
